<h1>The Best Series According to Vivek</h1>
<h2>My top 3 series of all time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>White Collar</h3>
<p>This is one the best series out there with a con man as a consultant for the cops</p>

<h3>Lucifer</h3>
<p>This is also a series about a consultant but it actually as the devil himself as the consultant</p>

<h3>Forever</h3>
<p>Man this one is crazy. Its about a guy who actually cannot stay died so he becomes a mortury doc and find why the others die</p>

<hr>
<p>Give these a go and say if you really like any of those</p>
